# Data Science 1: Introduction to Python for Data Science

# Content in Jupyter Notebooks

The primary source of content will be relatively bare Jupyter Notebooks where the instructor will guide you through discovering the different features of Python, NumPy, Pandas, and general data cleaning and manipulation. There is also a folder called "Reference Material" which has all of the same content in the primary notebooks, plus written explanations and additional features not covered in this workshop.

*Notice*: Various interactive cues are called out in the Notebooks. These are suggestions and at the instructor's discression.
